## About

The Pinch Components package provides reusable, framework-agnostic components that can be used independently or as part
of the Pinch Framework. These components embody the framework's type-safe, API-first philosophy, offering robust
building blocks for modern PHP 8.4 applications, including HTTP clients, validation, serialization, and domain-driven
design patterns.

## Installation

```bash
composer require phoneburner/pinch-component
```
