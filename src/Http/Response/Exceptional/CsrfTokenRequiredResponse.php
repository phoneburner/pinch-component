 * A "403 Forbidden" is the most appropriate status code for a CSRF token failure:
 *  - It is a 4xx client side type error.
 *  - The request is understood and assumed to be otherwise valid.
 *  - The user is authenticated, as CSRF relies on user session context.
 *  - The server refuses further action because the token is invalid.
 *
 * Thus, the user does not have permission to act on the resource because the token is invalid.
 * and we can use the "403 Forbidden" status code to indicate this.
